# CLEAN_1.5.4_PHOBOS
I heard some people were privately passing around a clean phobos 1.5.4 jar so I decided to make one myself. MixinClassTransformer was removed and ReflectionUtil was edited. I also added the hidden AutoCrystal rewrite (called crystal aura) to the module manager so It can be used (It replaces bowspam cus im lazy).


Edit: The file size is wierd because the compression is fucked
